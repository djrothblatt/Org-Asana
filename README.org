* Introduction
  ~org-asana.el~ is an Emacs package to sync a user's tasks from [[http://asana.com][Asana]]
  to Org Mode. Very much a work in progress, but the very basics work
  right now!
* Using ~org-asana.el~
** Getting a Personal Access Token
   If you don't have an Asana [[https://asana.com/developers/documentation/getting-started/auth#personal-access-token][personal access token]] for your account,
   get one by following the instructions there.
   Then set ~org-asana/token~ somewhere (preferably somewhere not in
   version control, as this token is supposed to be kept secret):

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (setq org-asana/token ...)
   #+END_SRC
** Pulling tasks
   Run ~M-x org-asana/pull-tasks~ in a buffer to get your tasks
   organized into nested ~TODOs~.
*** TODO Additional task details
** TODO Pushing tasks
   This is not implemented yet. Eventually you should be able to ~M-x
   org-asana/push-tasks~ inside an Org buffer to synch any changes
   you've made to Asana.
